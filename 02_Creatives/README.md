# 02_Creatives

This folder is there to generate derivative images for each static banner type.

Just drag & drop a JPEG image ending with the file extension `jpg` and it will automatically generate the images in the right formats and in the right folder (under `build`). After being generated, the original image is then deleted. _Don't panic!_

## Requirements for best banner rendering

- Image needs to be bigger than 800*800px
- Image has a square ratio
- The subject is borderless and centered vertically and horizontally
- The image has the sRGB color profile
