# Relative Wrapper

When needed use the relative wrapper to set a relative position for the notification

```
<div class="o-notification-wrapper">
    <div class="o-notification">
        ...
    </div>
</div>
```


# z-index

The notification has a z-index of value 20 by default. 
Pay attention to nearing components and their z-index value.
