### Grids 

Grids must be created **on demand** with Susy (a famous grid tool doing all the math for you)

Docs: http://oddbird.net/susy/docs/
Why: https://css-tricks.com/build-web-layouts-easily-susy/


### Examples

```
.o-header {
    &__row {
        @include clearfix(); 
    }    
    
    &__col-1 {
        @include span(4 of 12 first)
    }
    
    &__col-2 {
         @include span(8 of 12 last)
    }
}

```

### Override Default Grid Settings (Check Susy Docs for all options)
```

$obj-layout-1-layout: (
    gutters: 4,
);

.o-header {
    &__col {
        @include with-layout($obj-layout-1-layout) {
            @include breakpoint($mq-md-up) {
                @include span(8 of 12);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
