## Progressive Enhancement
Progressive Enhancement (PE) is the principle of starting with a rock-solid foundation and then adding enhancements to it if you know certain visiting user-agents can handle the improved experience.

  - The first layer is clean, semantic HTML. This allows text-based, speech-based, antiquated and robotic user-agents to navigate the content of your website properly.
  - The second layer is CSS. This allows visual-based user-agents to display or alter the visual representation of your websiteâ€™s content.
  - The third layer is JavaScript. This allows user-agents that are capable of using it to provide your users with enhanced usability.
