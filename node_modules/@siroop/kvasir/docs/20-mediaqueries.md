Mediaqueries and breakpoints are pre-defined and can be used in scss only!
It's not allowed to use custom breakpoints anywhere.

## Breakpoints
  - Small: < 768px
  - Medium: 768px
  - Large: 1024px
  - X-Large: 1200px 


## Usage
To include a breakpoint, use the scss-helper `breakpoint()`

```
// Example
.m-mymolecule {
    // small default
    @include breakpoint($mq-medium-up) {
        background: #ff0000;
    }
}
```
