# Contribute to Kvasir
Contributions are welcome and are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## How to contribute
Contributions can be made by opening a pull request.
To keep the repository clean and maintainable we have to stick to some basic rules.

### Before you open a pull request
* Read the [Documentation](docs)
* Add a description that describes what you want to achieve
* Your code must follow the existing methodologies and patterns.
* Code must be linted and must not show lint errors or warnings
* Keep your pull request small, only add one feature in the pull request.
* Rebase your branch from develop before opening the PR, no merge conflicts must be visible.

Pullrequests that do not follow the basic rules will be closed and have to be fixed and reopened again.
Ask [@gempi](https://github.com/gempi) [@aiwatko](https://github.com/aiwatko) or [@jackblackCH](https://github.com/jackblackCH) for help.
