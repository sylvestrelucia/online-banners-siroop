### Online banners for Doubleclick
This tool was created to allow online marketers and creatives to publish online banners.
- **As a online marketer**, I can add and edit the banner details on a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WTqvEYtfxTTAxat7yuplbz5kMKPJupRzOsWtw4CxE2A/edit?usp=sharing).
- **As a creative**, I can get the banner details, add the creative image to the appropriate banner and prepare the production zip files.
- **As a online marketer**, I can upload these created zip files on Google DCM so that they get published.
- **As a online marketer**, I can upload the dynamic banners (prospective & retargeting) with a visual preview.
- **As a creative director**, I can QA the banners before they go on production.
- **As a frontend developer**, I can use the same design system patterns to generate online banners.
- **As a user**, the banners are optimized so that they render fast even on mobile and on different screen resolutions.
